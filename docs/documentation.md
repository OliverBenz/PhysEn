# Documentation

## Requirements
Make sure you have doxygen installed on your system before trying to
generate the documentation.
- Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -Sy doxygen`
- Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install doxygen`

## Generate
The documentation can simply be generated by running doxygen
inside the main directory:
- `git clone https://github.com/OliverBenz/PhysEn.git`
- `cd PhysEn`
- `doxygen .doxygen-config`

You can then find the documentation under:
`docs/doxygen/html/index.html`
